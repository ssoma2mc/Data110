        "## 4.1 Key findings from the analysis\n",
        "\n",
        "The analysis of life expectancy data reveals significant regional and income-based disparities in global life expectancy trends. The global average life expectancy is 72.59 years, but this figure masks substantial variation across countries and regions. Notably, North America boasts the highest life expectancy, while Sub-Saharan Africa reports the lowest. The range of life expectancy spans from 53.28 years in the lowest to 84.36 years in the highest. Income group also plays a critical role in shaping life expectancy, with high-income countries having an average life expectancy of 78.85 years, compared to 56.56 years in low-income countries.\n",
        "\n",
        "Further analysis indicates that the impact of key predictors on life expectancy, such as health expenditure, education expenditure, and CO2 emissions, differs by income group. In high-income countries, health expenditure plays a more significant role in improving life expectancy, while education expenditure has a greater impact in low-income countries. Additionally, the relationship between CO2 emissions and life expectancy is complex: CO2 emissions seem to have a positive effect on life expectancy at lower levels (<= 35,000), but the effect turns negative when emissions exceed 35,000.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, there are limitations in the available CO2 data, particularly the presence of extreme values and the assumption of a linear relationship between emissions and life expectancy. Given these limitations, more sophisticated modeling techniques and further investigation into CO2 emissions data are necessary for more accurate conclusions.\n",
