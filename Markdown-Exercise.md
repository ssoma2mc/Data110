## Task 2: Emphasis
*"keep looking for Truth in the wrong place, and you will never find it. Stop looking there, out there. Find Truth here, where Truth resides"*

About the book
*Thus Spoke the Plant* by Monica Gagliano explores groundbreaking scientific discoveries about plant intelligence and communication. Drawing on both personal encounters and extensive research, Gagliano reveals how plants perceive, learn, and respond to their environment in ways previously thought impossible. She discusses the complex relationships between humans and plants, blending science with personal anecdotes. The book challenges conventional views on plant consciousness, presenting plants as active, responsive beings. Through this journey, Gagliano encourages a deeper connection and respect for the plant world.

## Task 10: Footnotes
- "Here, the Earth secures the roots of both Socoba and the Shipibo people, and the Cosmos, unconcerned by the specific nature of their complexion, incribes itself onto thier skin.[^1]"
- "It is at the skin that the tree and the shaman meet, a cressroad of scared offerings where a wound is etched in the body of one to heal that of the other.[^2]"
[^1]:"Plants don't have a skin as such, but they do have dermal tissue, or epidermis, to protect their inner from the outer."
[^2]:"When the leaves of *Himatanthus sucuuba* are broken off thier stems, and when the stems are broken from the branches, a milky-white fluid material, latex, is exuded. Wounding the three bark will also exude the latex. The latex of this tree is a popular natural remedy in Peruvian herbalism, and its long-standing use for healing wounds was verified by Peruvian researchers in an animal study published in 1997 (see L.Villegas, I.D. Fernández, H.Maldonado, R.Torres, A.Zavaleta, A.J.Vaisberg, and G.B.Hammond, "Evaluation of the Wound-Healing Activity of Aelected Traditional Medicinal Plants from Peru." *Journal of Ethnopharmacology* 55 (1997): 193-200). *Himatanthus sucuuba* is one of more than twenty thousand plant species from forty differebt families that produce latex. Despite its ubiquity, which attests to its biological significance, the function of latex in nature is not fully understood. It is most likely used by the plants as part of a defensive mechanism against herbivory such as the delivery of anti-harbivory compounds and rapid wound healing. See G.Bauer, C.Friedrich, C.Gilling, F.Vollrath, T.Speck, and C.Holland, "Investigation the Pheological Properties of Native Pland Latex," *Journal of the Royal Society Interface* 11(2014): 20130847.
